#Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. I had access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. This project was part of a Kaggle competition where I scored a 79.5% accuracy.

**Acknowledgments:** this dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website [here](https://appen.com/resources/datasets/).
